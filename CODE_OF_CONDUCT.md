# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

This Code of Conduct also applies to behavior outside of community spaces when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.

## Reporting Guidelines

### How to Report

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please report it by contacting the project team at:

- **Email**: [conduct@verb.sh](mailto:conduct@verb.sh)
- **GitHub**: Create a private security advisory
- **Discord**: Direct message to moderators

### What to Include

When reporting, please include:

- **Your contact information** (so we can get in touch with you if we need to follow up)
- **Names** (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved
- **Description** of what happened, including specific behaviors
- **When and where** the incident occurred
- **Any additional context** that might be helpful
- **Evidence** such as screenshots, logs, or links (if available and appropriate)

### Confidentiality

All reports will be handled with discretion. We will protect the identity of the reporter and respect their confidentiality. In some cases, we may need to take public action, but we will consult with the reporter first when possible.

## Enforcement Process

### Investigation

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of the report within 24 hours
2. **Investigation**: We will investigate the incident thoroughly and fairly
3. **Decision**: Based on our investigation, we will determine appropriate action

### Consequences

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

#### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

#### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

#### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

#### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Appeals Process

If you believe you have been wrongly accused or that the penalty is too severe, you may appeal the decision by:

1. **Contacting the team** at [conduct@verb.sh](mailto:conduct@verb.sh) within 14 days
2. **Providing additional context** or information that may not have been considered
3. **Requesting a review** by a different community leader if possible

Appeals will be reviewed by community leaders who were not involved in the original decision when possible.

## Community Leaders

Community leaders are expected to follow these guidelines themselves and may be subject to removal from their position for violations.
